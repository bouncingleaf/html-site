      <h3>About... Leaf?</h3>
      <p>
        Years ago, a friend called me by my username, which was jroy. I said:
        "Hey, if you're not going to call me by my name, at least come up with a
        new name for me."
      </p>
      <p>
        A few days later, said friend gave me a new name: Bouncing Leaf. "Leaf,"
        for short. I used that online, it stuck.
      </p>
      <h3>When I'm not at the keyboard</h3>
      <p>
        I can often be found walking in a nature sanctuary, looking for birds.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm also teaching myself Spanish in my spare time. I don't have much
        spare time, so it's slow going! I highly recommend:
